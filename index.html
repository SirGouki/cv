      <h1>Skills</h1>

      <h3>
        Software Development
        <img src="./images/web-development.png" alt="console-img" style="position: relative; display: block; height: 128px; width: 128px; left:47%;" />
      </h3>
      I am proficient in C#, C++, and other programming languages.<br />
      I have developed some (small) games, helped fix bugs on a private server for a game, as well as assisted others in various problems they have come across.<br />
      I have also made very basic operating systems, and other projects on the Raspberry Pi.
      <hr style="margin-bottom:0; margin-top: 22px;" />
      <h3>
        Gaming
        <img src="./images/controller.png" alt="controller-img" style="position: relative; display: block; height: 128px; width: 128px; left:47%;" />
      </h3>
      I have enjoyed playing games of all kinds for many years.<br />
      While some may consider this just a hobby, it is often over looked just how much skill goes in to playing games really well.<br />
      Playing games takes good problem solving skills, good math skills, good timing, and sometimes it can be just as stressful as the most demanding jobs.<br />
      <hr style="margin-bottom:0; margin-top: 22px;" />
      <h3>
        Art
        <img src="./images/sketchpad.png" alt="sketchpad-img" style="position: relative; display: block; height: 128px; width: 128px; left:47%;" />
      </h3>
      I have designed my own pixel art for games, also known as sprites. This includes animating game characters.<br />
      I have also done some 3D modeling, just to learn a new skill.<br />
      <div style="height: 64px; width: 100%; position:static; display: block;"></div>
      <h1>Knowledge</h1>
      I have always lived my life with the outlook that more knowledge about anything is a good thing.<br />
      Even as young as grade school, I've always desired to learn something I don't know.<br />
      If I can't make use of my knowledge in any other way, I at least try to pass my knowledge on to those who need it.<br /><br />
      Most of my knowledge comes from looking up tutorials, reading documentation, or reading books when I can get my hands on them.<br />
      This also includes helping others to solve problems with their own projects, <br />and information I've obtained by working with others by contributing to open source projects.

      <h1>Hobbies</h1>
      <h3>Learning</h3>
      I love to learn. There's always something interesting out there waiting to be discoverd.<br />
      To quote a famous video game series:
      <em>"There is no knowledge that is not power."</em>
      <hr style="margin-bottom:0; margin-top: 22px;" />
      <h3>Reading</h3>
      Sometimes, it's good to just get away from the world and sit back with a good book or article.
      <hr style="margin-bottom:0; margin-top: 22px;" />
      <h3>Designing</h3>
      Others, it's fun to just play with a quick mock up of a house design, or a game idea.
      <hr style="margin-bottom:0; margin-top: 22px;" />
      <h3>Technology</h3>
      Maybe, it's just my love of knowledge, but I absolutely love new technology.<br />
      Whether it's a new phone, a single board computer, or sometimes even a childrens toy, technology just calls out to me.<br />
      <hr style="margin-bottom:0; margin-top: 22px;" />
      <h3>Swords</h3>
      Like technology, something about a good sword just gets my attention every time, especially Japanese and Medieval era swords.
