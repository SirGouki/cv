      <h3>Welcome.</h3>
      <p style="width: 50%;">
        I am a very self driven developer. This is proven by the fact that the majority
        of my knowledge stems from learning from tutorials, snippets found online, and whatever
        reading material I can get my hands on. I went so far as to purchase a web development course,
        not because I needed it, but because I was curious as to how web development differs from
        other software development. Here, you will find just a little bit more about me.

          <h3>Software Development</h3>

          I am proficient in C#, C++, and other programming languages.<br />
          I have developed some (small) games, helped fix bugs on a private server for a game, as well as assisted others in various problems they have come across.<br />
          I have also made very basic operating systems, and other projects on the Raspberry Pi.

          <h3>Gaming</h3>

          I have enjoyed playing games of all kinds for many years.<br />
          While some may consider this just a hobby, it is often over looked just how much skill goes in to playing games really well.<br />
          Playing games takes good problem solving skills, good math skills, good timing, and sometimes it can be just as stressful as the most demanding jobs.<br />

          <h3>Art</h3>

          I have designed my own pixel art for games, also known as sprites. This includes animating game characters.<br />
          I have also done some 3D modeling, just to learn a new skill.<br />

      <h1>Knowledge</h1>
      I have always lived my life with the outlook that more knowledge about anything is a good thing.<br />
      Even as young as grade school, I've always desired to learn something I don't know.<br />
      If I can't make use of my knowledge in any other way, I at least try to pass my knowledge on to those who need it.<br /><br />
      Most of my knowledge comes from looking up tutorials, reading documentation, or reading books when I can get my hands on them.<br />
      This also includes helping others to solve problems with their own projects, <br />and information I've obtained by working with others by contributing to open source projects.

      <h1>Hobbies</h1>
      <h3>Learning</h3>
      I love to learn. There's always something interesting out there waiting to be discoverd.<br />
      To quote a famous video game series:
      <em>"There is no knowledge that is not power."</em>

      <hr />

      <h3>Reading</h3>
      Sometimes, it's good to just get away from the world and sit back with a good book or article.
      <hr />
      <h3>Designing</h3>
      Others, it's fun to just play with a quick mock up of a house design, or a game idea.
      <hr />
      <h3>Technology</h3>
      Maybe, it's just my love of knowledge, but I absolutely love new technology.<br />
      Whether it's a new phone, a single board computer, or sometimes even a childrens toy, technology just calls out to me.<br />
      <hr />
      <h3>Swords</h3>
      Like technology, something about a good sword just gets my attention every time, especially Japanese and Medieval era swords.
